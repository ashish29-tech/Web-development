Js is the only programming language which is understood by our browser.

PL: Where we write Logical layer. Where we write our logic using any language.

Static vs. Interactive websites.

Before 1995 all websites were static.
For interactivity 1995 m js use hone lagi thi. 

PL are of 2 types. Compiled and Interpreted.

Compiled...c++, Java...pura code Compiled hoga and fir execute hoga.
Interpreted...JS...line by line chalta hai...error aa gya toh uske aage nahi chalegi.

In PL we work with data and data are of two types...
Primitive and Non-primitive.

Primitive: Data types which can't be broken further down into simpler data.

Non-primitive: 


How many primitives do we have ?
Js m everything is a number.
number, string, boolean, undefined, symbol, null, bigInt

Unlike other PL js doesn't have int, float.

Let, var, const are declaratives.

variable: a way to store a value. 

In case of js...values are not stored in the form of bucket..variable points to the value.
