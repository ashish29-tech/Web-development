# 🌐 Web Development

Welcome to my **Web-Development** repository!  
This repo is a collection of my **learnings, notes, projects, and practice code** while exploring the world of web development.  
Here, I document everything step by step — from basics to advanced concepts — so it can serve as both a **reference for me** and a **guide for others** who are learning web development. 🚀
