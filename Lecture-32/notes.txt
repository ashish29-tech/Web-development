NO NEED TO CRAM THIS DOM...CUZ IT'S NOT ASKED IN INTERVIEW OR MAYBE VERY BASIC ASKED.

DOM: Document Object Model. 
Document means HTML.
Everything inside js is object. So object se matlab hua js ko refer karna chah rahe hai.
Model means to change/manipulate... 

DOM..html ke andar jakar just with the help of js usse change kar pao.

DOM allows JavaScript to modify HTML dynamically without directly editing the HTML file.
The browser converts HTML into a DOM tree, which JavaScript can access and manipulate.


First appraoch is to select the element which needs to be manipulated.
We have many ways to select. We'll be seeing 5 ways.
