# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# 🌐 Web Development

Welcome to my **Web-Development** repository!  
This repo is a collection of my **learnings, notes, projects, and practice code** while exploring the world of web development.  
Here, I document everything step by step — from basics to advanced concepts — so it can serve as both a **reference for me** and a **guide for others** who are learning web development. 🚀

---

## 📚 Contents

### 1️⃣ Basics of Web Development
- Introduction to the Web (How websites work)
- HTML5 (structure & semantics)
- CSS3 (styling, flexbox, grid, animations)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, ES6+ features)

### 2️⃣ Advanced Frontend
- Responsive Design (Media Queries, Mobile-first approach)
- Modern JavaScript (Async/Await, Fetch API, Promises)
- Frameworks & Libraries:  
  - React.js  
  - TailwindCSS  
  - Bootstrap  

### 3️⃣ Backend Development
- Node.js Basics (event-driven programming, modules)
- Express.js (routes, middleware, APIs)
- REST API development
- Authentication & Authorization (JWT, Sessions)

### 4️⃣ Databases
- MongoDB (NoSQL basics, CRUD operations, Mongoose)
- SQL / PostgreSQL (queries, schema design, relations)

### 5️⃣ Tools & DevOps
- Git & GitHub (version control)
- Postman (API testing)
- Docker (container basics)
- Deployment (Vercel, Netlify, Render, Railway)

### 6️⃣ Full-Stack Projects
- Mini projects to practice integration of frontend + backend + database

## 🚀 Goals of This Repository
- 📒 Maintain detailed notes for quick revision  
- 💻 Store code snippets & small projects for hands-on practice  
- 🌍 Build step-by-step towards becoming a **Full-Stack Web Developer (MERN)**  
- 🛠 Keep improving by adding new learnings regularly

## 🏆 Long-Term Goal

By the end of this journey, I aim to have a **strong full-stack skillset**, with:

* 10+ mini projects
* 3+ full-stack applications
* Solid understanding of **MERN stack + deployment**
