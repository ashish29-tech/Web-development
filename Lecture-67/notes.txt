-React
. Library
. SPA (SEO ⬇  Faster ⬆)
. Virtual DOM
. Reuse of component
. Component based architecture
. 2 types of components...class & function. React suggest using function based component not class based component. Class is stateful and finction based component is stateless. 
Functional Components...Lekin React 16.8 me Hooks aaye, aur ab functional components bhi state aur lifecycle handle kar sakte hain.

Babel is a compiler which converts JSX into pure js(vanilla js..jo ab tak js ham likhte aye hai)...and then send it to browser.
babeljs.io official docs
babel third party chiz hai to ise use karne ke liye..babel ka code chahiye hoga...isliye babel cdn google kiya.



kya ham kai sare js file bna sakte hai ? yes
cat.js, index.js, dog,js...in sabme actually m jsx likha hoga...un sari file ko jsx m convert kon karega...Babel.
But ho sakta hai in sab js file ke corresponding hamare paas css file bhi ho...so in sabko and js ki sari files ko convert kar ke ultimately js m convert karna and then browser ko bhejna...
Ye sara convert ka kaam...webpacks/bundlers karte hai..
Bundlers ka kaam hota hai..sari file ko bundle kar ke..ek single usable js file m convert...
Bundlers are of many types...webpacks, vite, parcel.. etc. 
webpacks is not a good bundler...vite and parcel are good.
Jab ham create-react-app jab use karte hai to bundler hamara webpack hota hai...

- Click on create react app on right side on old react docs
npx create-react-app my-app ...npx is node package executor..ye is command ko install karne ke sath-sath chala bhi dega

npx create-react-app react-basic (create-basic is folder name and basic ka b capital nai hoga)
cd react-basic(folder name)
npm start


sirf ek hi HTML file hoti hai(public folder m) pure react app m...cuz react app ek hi baar render hoti hai...refreshing nai hoti cuz SPA hai...


Since webpacks are not efficient...we'll create an app from vite
vite is also a bundler.


We'll use Vite. It's faster.
